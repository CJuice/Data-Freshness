The map shows present traffic as a blend of live and typical information. Live speeds are used wherever available and are established from real-time sensor readings. Typical speeds come from a record of average speeds, which are collected over several weeks within the last year or so. Layers also show current incident locations where available. By changing the map time, the service can also provide past and future conditions. Live readings from sensors are saved for 12 hours, so setting the map time back within 12 hours allows you to see a actual recorded traffic speeds, supplemented with typical averages by default. You can choose to turn off the average speeds and see only the recorded live traffic speeds for any time within the 12-hour window. Predictive traffic conditions are shown for any time in the future.The color-coded traffic map layer can be used to represent relative traffic speeds; this is a common type of a map for online services and is used to provide context for routing, navigation, and field operations. A color-coded traffic map can be requested for the current time and any time in the future. A map for a future request might be used for planning purposes.The map also includes dynamic traffic incidents showing the location of accidents, construction, closures, and other issues that could potentially impact the flow of traffic. Traffic incidents are commonly used to provide context for routing, navigation and field operations. Incidents are not features; they cannot be exported and stored for later use or additional analysis.Data sourceEsri\u2019s typical speed records and live and predictive traffic feeds come directly from HERE (www.HERE.com). HERE collects billions of GPS and cell phone probe records per month and, where available, uses sensor and toll-tag data to augment the probe data collected. An advanced algorithm compiles the data and computes accurate speeds. The real-time and predictive traffic data is updated every five minutes through traffic feeds.Data coverageThe service works globally and can be used to visualize traffic speeds and incidents in many countries. Check the service coverage web map to determine availability in your area of interest. Look at the coverage map to learn whether a country currently supports traffic. The support for traffic incidents can be determined by identifying a country. For detailed information on this service, visit the directions and routing documentation and the ArcGIS Help.SymbologyTraffic speeds are displayed as a percentage of free-flow speeds, which is frequently the speed limit or how fast cars tend to travel when unencumbered by other vehicles. The streets are color coded as follows:Green (fast): 85 - 100% of free flow speedsYellow (moderate): 65 - 85%Orange (slow); 45 - 65%Red (stop and go): 0 - 45%To view live traffic only\u2014that is, excluding typical traffic conditions\u2014enable the Live Traffic layer and disable the Traffic layer. (You can find these layers under World\/Traffic > [region] > [region] Traffic). To view more comprehensive traffic information that includes live and typical conditions, disable the Live Traffic layer and enable the Traffic layer.ArcGIS Online organization subscriptionImportant Note:The World Traffic map service is available for users with an ArcGIS Online organizational subscription.

SLOSH is a computerized model run by the National Weather Service to estimate storm surge heights resulting from historical, hypothetical, or predicted hurricanes. The model creates its estimates by assessing the pressure, size, forward speed, track, and wind data from a storm. Graphical output from the model displays color-coded storm surge heights for a particular area. The calculations are applied to a specific locale's shoreline, incorporating the unique bay and river configurations, water depths, bridges, roads, and other physical features.

The Trust Fund allows Maryland to accelerate Bay restoration by focusing limited financial resources on the most effective non-point source pollution control projects. Dollars for the Trust Fund are generated through motor fuel tax and rental car tax in Maryland. It is anticipated that when fully-funded, the Trust Fund will generate $50M annually. This file depicts the Bay Trust Fund current priority zones. Priority zone areas were developed using information from the USGS SPARROW model and local knowledge and expertise. Coastal Bays watersheds were prioritized based on the expertise of scientists in that region. - SPARROW is a regression-based model for regional interpretation of water quality monitoring data. SPARROW discriminates which watersheds are likely to contribute the highest nutrient and sediment loads to the Chesapeake Bay. - The Biological Restoration Initiative (BRI) targeting identifies biologically impaired waters that demonstrate a high potential for removal from Marylands 303(d) list of impaired waters. Their selection is based on evaluation using the Biological Listing Methodology results listed in Marylands 2008 Integrated Report, which sets a threshold for degradation within Marylands non-tidal freshwater streams using the index of biotic integrity (IBI) scores from sampled fish and benthic communities. These watersheds have been targeted primarily for 319(h) grant program, which has a goal of delisting impaired surface waters. - The Atlantic Coastal Bay watersheds were selected based on the pattern of trajectories of the water quality index (dissolved oxygen, chlorophyll a, total nitrogen, total phosphorus) between 2001-2006 (http:\/\/ian.umces.edu\/press\/books\/publication\/93\/shifting_sands_envi ronmental_and_cultural_change_in_maryland_s_coastal_bays_2009- 06-08\/). Agricultural and urbanized watersheds were evaluated separately to identify the highest nutrient loading areas. For urban watersheds developed lands were analyzed, while agricultural watersheds were separated into cropland and animal production systems.\u00a0This is a MD iMAP hosted service.

The three components are: (1) designated uses that set goals for each water body (e.g., recreational use), (2) criteria that set the minimum conditions to support the use (e.g., bacterial concentrations below certain concentrations) and (3) an antidegradation policy that maintains high quality waters so they are not allowed to degrade to meet only the minimum standards. The designated uses and criteria set the minimum standards for Tier I. Maryland's antidegradation policy has been promulgated in three regulations within the Code of Maryland Regulations (COMAR): COMAR 26.08.02.04 sets out the policy itself, COMAR 26.08.02.04-1, which is discussed here, provides for implementation of Tier II (high quality waters) of the antidegradation policy, and COMAR 26.08.02.04-2 that describes Tier III (Outstanding National Resource Waters or ONRW), the highest quality waters. No Tier III waters have been designated at this time. Tier II antidegradation implementation has the greatest immediate effect on local government planning functions so the Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) has prepared this set of Tier II GIS data layers to provide technical assistance to local governments working to complete the Water Resources Element of their comprehensive plans as required by HB 1141. As part of this process, MDE has created this dataset representing the official record of all Maryland Tier II (high quality) stream segments as determined by MDE, the regulatory agency responsible for identification and listing of Maryland's Tier II waters. This dataset consists of a digital geospatial representation of all identified Tier II segments which includes those stream segments promulgated in (COMAR) 26.08.02.04-1, and those additional segments proposed during the current Triennial Review of Maryland Regulations, known as the pending list. Pending segments are Tier II segments awaiting promulgation. This is a vector line file that was developed using the 24,000:1 scale National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) coverage for Maryland, and each identified Tier II stream segment has been linked to the NHD using the unique common identifier (COMID) code. MDE uses Maryland Biological Stream Survey (MBSS) data for designating streams as Tier II. Using all MBSS stations sampled within a stream reach (defined as a section of stream from confluence to confluence), an arithmetic mean of the benthic index of biotic integrity (IBI) and the fish IBI is calculated. Only if the means of both the benthic and fish IBIs are greater than or equal to 4.00 is a stream reach designated as Tier II. As such, Tier II streams represent the best streams in Maryland in terms of water quality, water chemistry, habitat, and biotic assemblages. Tier II stream segments can range in length generally terminating at confluences, impoundment outfalls, and tidal boundaries. However, in planning activities, one should consider the entire upstream watershed to a Tier II stream as any changes to this watershed can potentially have an effect on the water quality of the Tier II stream. It is worth noting that once a stream segment is designated as Tier II, this designation lasts in perpetuity regardless of changes in water quality or local landuse.

The three components are: (1) designated uses that set goals for each water body (e.g., recreational use), (2) criteria that set the minimum conditions to support the use (e.g., bacterial concentrations below certain concentrations) and (3) an antidegradation policy that maintains high quality waters so they are not allowed to degrade to meet only the minimum standards. The designated uses and criteria set the minimum standards for Tier I. Maryland's antidegradation policy has been promulgated in three regulations within the Code of Maryland Regulations (COMAR): COMAR 26.08.02.04 sets out the policy itself, COMAR 26.08.02.04-1, which is discussed here, provides for implementation of Tier II (high quality waters) of the antidegradation policy, and COMAR 26.08.02.04-2 that describes Tier III (Outstanding National Resource Waters or ONRW), the highest quality waters. No Tier III waters have been designated at this time. Tier II antidegradation implementation has the greatest immediate effect on local government planning functions so the Maryland Department of the Environment (MDE) has prepared this set of Tier II GIS data layers to provide technical assistance to local governments working to complete the Water Resources Element of their comprehensive plans as required by HB 1141. As part of this process, MDE has created this dataset representing the official record of all Maryland Tier II (high quality) stream segments as determined by MDE, the regulatory agency responsible for identification and listing of Maryland's Tier II waters. This dataset consists of a digital geospatial representation of all identified Tier II segments which includes those stream segments promulgated in (COMAR) 26.08.02.04-1, and those additional segments proposed during the current Triennial Review of Maryland Regulations, known as the pending list. Pending segments are Tier II segments awaiting promulgation. This is a vector line file that was developed using the 24,000:1 scale National Hydrography Dataset (NHD) coverage for Maryland, and each identified Tier II stream segment has been linked to the NHD using the unique common identifier (COMID) code. MDE uses Maryland Biological Stream Survey (MBSS) data for designating streams as Tier II. Using all MBSS stations sampled within a stream reach (defined as a section of stream from confluence to confluence), an arithmetic mean of the benthic index of biotic integrity (IBI) and the fish IBI is calculated. Only if the means of both the benthic and fish IBIs are greater than or equal to 4.00 is a stream reach designated as Tier II. As such, Tier II streams represent the best streams in Maryland in terms of water quality, water chemistry, habitat, and biotic assemblages. Tier II stream segments can range in length generally terminating at confluences, impoundment outfalls, and tidal boundaries. However, in planning activities, one should consider the entire upstream watershed to a Tier II stream as any changes to this watershed can potentially have an effect on the water quality of the Tier II stream. It is worth noting that once a stream segment is designated as Tier II, this designation lasts in perpetuity regardless of changes in water quality or local landuse.

Thirty-five older, less accurate, overlapping surveys were entirely omitted before tinning. Partial overlap from other older, less accurate surveys was also omitted prior to tinning. The surveys used dated from 1859 to 1993. Thirty-six surveys dated from 1859 to 1918, thirty-seven from the 1930s, ninety-one from the 1940s, sixty- six from the 1950s, twenty-five from the 1960s, twenty-four from the 1970s, fourteen from the 1980s, and four from the 1990s. The total range of sounding data was 3.7 meters to -50.4 meters at mean low water. Mean high water values between 0.2 and 1.2 meters were assigned to the shoreline. Fifteen points were found that were not consistent with the surrounding data and were removed prior to tinning. DEM grid values outside the shoreline (on land) were assigned null values (-32676). Chesapeake Bay has two hundred eighteen 7.5 minute DEMs and ten one degree DEMs. The 1 degree DEMs were generated from the higher resolution 7.5 minute DEMs which covered the estuary. A Digital Elevation Model (DEM) contains a series of elevations ordered from south to north with the order of the columns from west to east. The DEM is formatted as one ASCII header record (A- record), followed by a series of profile records (B- records) each of which include a short B-record header followed by a series of ASCII integer elevations (typically in units of 1 centimeter) per each profile. The last physical record of the DEM is an accuracy record (C- record). The 7.5-minute DEM (30- by 30-m data spacing) is cast on the Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) projection. It provides coverage in 7.5- by 7.5-minute blocks. Each product provides the same coverage as a standard USGS 7.5-minute quadrangle but the DEM contains over edge data. Coverage is available for many estuaries of the contiguous United States but is not complete. This layer was modified from its original form. Please see lineage section for details. Not to be used for Navigation. Acknowledgment of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration - Nation Ocean Service would be appreciated in products derived from these data. The datum for these bathymetric DEMs is not the same as that used by the US Geological survey (USGS) for land based DEMs which results in a discontinuity if the two datasets are merged together. Moreover, the shoreline for the USGS DEMs is indeterminate and not the same as that used for the Bathymetric DEMs. The data within the bathymetry file is floating point. When using the data within a GIS care must be taken to ensure that the data are being read as floating point and not integer data.This is a MD iMAP hosted service layer.

Area of broadband availability refers to those individual US Census Blocks, less than 2 square miles, where each facilities-based provider of broadband service can provide broadband services of minimal characteristics within 7 - 10 business days. For this purpose, ''broadband service'' is the provision, on either a commercial or non-commercial basis, of data transmission technology that provides two-way data transmission to and from the Internet with advertised speeds of at least 768 kilobits per second (kbps) downstream and greater than 200 kbps upstream to end users, or providing sufficient capacity in a middle mile project to support the provision of broadband service to end-users within the project area. For this purpose, an ''end user'' of broadband service is a residential or business party, institution or State or local government entity that may use broadband service for its own purposes and that does not resell such service to other entities or incorporate such service into retail Internet-access services. Internet Service Providers (ISPs) are not ''end users'' for this purpose. An entity is a ''facilities based'' provider of broadband service connections to end user locations if any of the following conditions are met: (1) It owns the portion of the physical facility that terminates at the end user location; (2) it obtains unbundled network elements (UNEs), special access lines, or other leased facilities that terminate at the end user location and provisions\/equips them as broadband; or (3) it provisions\/equips a broadband wireless channel to the end user location over licensed or unlicensed spectrum.

However, census blocks in remote areas are often large and irregular and may even be many square miles in area. A common misunderstanding is that data users think census blocks are used geographically to build all other census geographic areas, rather all other census geographic areas are updated and then used as the primary constraints, along with roads and water features, to delineate the tabulation blocks. As a result, all 2010 Census blocks nest within every other 2010 Census geographic area, so that Census Bureau statistical data can be tabulated at the block level and aggregated up to the appropriate geographic areas.

An incorporated place is established to provide governmental functions for a concentration of people as opposed to a minor civil division (MCD), which generally is created to provide services or administer an area without regard, necessarily, to population. Places always nest within a State, but may extend across county and county subdivision boundaries. An incorporated place usually is a city, town, village, or borough, but can have other legal descriptions. CDPs are delineated for the decennial census as the statistical counterparts of incorporated places. CDPs are delineated to provide data for settled concentrations of population that are identifiable by name, but are not legally incorporated under the laws of the State in which they are located. The boundaries for CDPs often are defined in partnership with State, local, and\/or tribal officials and usually coincide with visible features or the boundary of an adjacent incorporated place or another legal entity. CDP boundaries often change from one decennial census to the next with changes in the settlement pattern and development; a CDP with the same name as in an earlier census does not necessarily have the same boundary. The only population\/housing size requirement for CDPs for the 2010 Census is that they must contain some housing and population. The boundaries of all 2010 Census incorporated places are as of January 1, 2010 as reported through the Census Bureau's Boundary and Annexation Survey (BAS).

To do so, we identified five key questions to assess each marsh:\u00a0How much is the marsh able to reduce the impact of coastal hazards?Is the marsh located where coastal hazards are a threat?Is the marsh located where there are people to protect?\u00a0Is the marsh located adjacent to other protective habitats?Is the marsh likely to survive in the face of rising sea levels?Using data from the Coastal Resiliency Assessment and other sources, we developed metrics to score each marsh on these five questions. Then, the sub-scores were combined to create the Marsh Protection Potential Index overall rating, which ranks the protective ability of over 14,000 marshes statewide.It is important to note that the MPPI ranks marshes relative to other marshes, rather than providing an absolute measure of protective services. The Marsh Protection Potential Index does not attempt to describe the dollar-value of protective services provided by each marsh, nor does it compare marshes to other types of habitat or to other protection infrastructure solutions. In addition, the MPPI does not assess marshes on any of the other characteristics that often inform conservation priorities. Things like biodiversity, ecosystem health, rare species, recreation value, or water quality services are often important to stakeholders, and these are not captured by the MPPI. The MPPI is intended to supplement, not replace, the other ways conservation decision-makers prioritize natural habitats.\u00a0The Department of Natural Resources makes no warranty, expressed or implied, as to the use or appropriateness of Spatial Data, and there are no warranties of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose or use.

These areas represent the most ecologically valuable areas in the State: they are the \"best of the best\". TEAs are preferred for conservation funding through Stateside Program Open Space. This version updates the 2008 TEA layer. The first step in updating TEAs was to create an ecological baseline composed of several ecological databases which included updates of original databases and additional databases developed since 2008.The first component is the updated Green Infrastructure Assessment (circa 2010) which identifies large, contiguous blocks (hubs) of significant forests and wetlands and their connecting corridors. The Green Infrastructure\u2019s hub and corridor network of habitat allows plant and animal migration, reduces forest fragmentation if protected, and provides important ecosystem services, such as biodiversity, cleaning air and water, storing nutrients, and protecting areas against storm and flood damage.The rare species and wildlife habitat component identifies areas that support Rare, Threatened, and Endangered Species, rare plant and animal communities, species of Greatest Conservation Need, and wildlife concentrations.The aquatic life hotspots component identifies watersheds supporting freshwater stream ecosystems where conservation is needed to protect and restore areas of high aquatic biodiversity, Tier II regulated streams, and brook trout streams.The water quality protection component identifies sensitive lands such as forests, wetlands, and steep slopes where preservation is important for water quality.The coastal ecosystems component identifies Blue Infrastructure shoreline and watershed protection priorities. These are areas important for sustaining coastal and tidal ecosystems and also identifies land areas important for sustaining spawning and nursery areas for important commercial and recreational fisheries.The climate change adaptation component identifies areas important for sustaining wetlands ecosystems that are changing and moving landward in response to sea level rise.From the ecological baseline, areas that ranked as most important for each of the components were merged to create the Targeted Ecological Areas. Lands that were developed, as identified by the Maryland Department of Planning (2010) were removed from the TEA layer since developed lands are not preferred for Stateside Program Open Space funding. Additionally, lands that are in the 0 foot to 2 foot inundation zone based on the 2011 SLAMM (Maryland Sea-Level Affecting Marshes Model) study performed for all 16 coastal counties and Baltimore City since these areas are not preferred for Stateside Program Open Space funding.This is a MD iMAP hosted service.

Knowledge of the timing and strength of tidal currents is extremely important for safe navigation in coastal waters. Tidal currents are almost always the strongest current experienced by vessels operating offshore and for considerable distances inside bays and river estuaries. Standardized procedures exist for analyzing tidal current data to separate the tidal and nontidal parameters. The tidal parameters are used to produce the National Ocean Service Tidal Current Tables. There are currently 41 tidal current reference stations where daily predictions are made based on information obtained in short-term current studies. Additional predictions are made for 2200 locations referenced to these tidal current reference stations. Predictions have varying degrees of accuracy dependant on the age of the data, the length of the measurements and the degree of non tidal influence a given location experiences. A clear understanding of current patterns in ports and estuaries which have economical and commercial importance is vital to ensure safe navigation and help in preventing accidents. In ports where currents are dominated by non-tidal factors, real-time current measurements are preferred.

Physiography is the study and classification of the natural landscape of the earth and the landforms that comprise it. The approach for the detailed physiographic map of Maryland is hierarchical and descriptive. Subdivisions are based on similarities (within) and differences (among) geologic structure, rock type, geomorphic history, and topographic characteristics. Data and subdivisions were compiled at a 1:100,000 scale for the detailed state-wide map. The hierarchical classification of the detailed physiographic map (in progress) includes subdivisions as follows, in descending order (and generally decreasing size): Province, Section, Region, District, Area. In Maryland there are portions of five physiographic Provinces. In this file, the polygons reflect Province level subdivision.

The Maryland Department of Natural Resources is not responsible for any inaccuracies in the data and does not necessarily endorse any uses or products derived from the data other than those for which the data were originally intended. Maryland's green infrastructure is a network of undeveloped lands that provide the bulk of the state's natural support system. Ecosystem services, such as cleaning the air, filtering water, storing and cycling nutrients, conserving soils, regulating climate, and maintaining hydrologic function, are all provided by the existing expanses of forests, wetlands, and other natural lands. These ecologically valuable lands also provide marketable goods and services, like forest products, fish and wildlife, and recreation. The Green Infrastructure serves as vital habitat for wild species and contributes in many ways to the health and quality of life for Maryland residents. To identify and prioritize Maryland's green infrastructure, we developed a tool called the Green Infrastructure Assessment (GIA). The GIA was based on principles of landscape ecology and conservation biology, and provides a consistent approach to evaluating land conservation and restoration efforts in Maryland. It specifically attempts to recognize: a variety of natural resource values (as opposed to a single species of wildlife, for example), how a given place fits into a larger system, the ecological importance of natural open space in rural and developed areas, the importance of coordinating local, state and even interstate planning, and the need for a regional or landscape-level view for wildlife conservation. The GIA identified two types of important resource lands - \"hubs\" and \"corridors.\" Gaps are developed, agricultural, mined, or cleared lands within the Green infrastructure network that could be targeted for restoration. These were evaluated for their potential restoration to forest, wetland, or riparian buffers, by considering watershed condition, landscape position, local features, ownership, and programmatic considerations. Gaps with hydric soils were probably once wetlands, and could be restored as such. Reforestation of gaps along streams would not only benefit wildlife, but improve water quality and stream stability.

The GIA identified two types of important resource lands - \"hubs\" and \"corridors.\" Hubs typically large contiguous areas, separated by major roads and\/or human land uses, that contain one or more of the following: Large blocks of contiguous interior forest (containing at least 250 acres, plus a transition zone of 300 feet) Large wetland complexes, with at least 250 acres of unmodified wetlands; Important animal and plant habitats of at least 100 acres, including rare, threatened, and endangered species locations, unique ecological communities, and migratory bird habitats; relatively pristine stream and river segments (which, when considered with adjacent forests and wetlands, are at least 100 acres) that support trout, mussels, and other sensitive aquatic organisms; and existing protected natural resource lands which contain one or more of the above (for example, state parks and forests, National Wildlife Refuges, locally owned reservoir properties, major stream valley parks, and Nature Conservancy preserves). In the GIA model, the above features were identified from Geographic Information Systems (GIS) spatial data that covered the entire state. Developed areas and major roads were excluded, areas less than 100 contiguous acres were dropped, adjacent forest and wetland were added to the remaining hubs, and the edges were smoothed. The average size of all hubs in the state is approximately 2200 acres. Corridors are linear features connecting hubs together to help animals and plant propagules to move between hubs. Corridors were identified using many sets of data, including land cover, roads, streams, slope, flood plains, aquatic resource data, and fish blockages. Generally speaking, corridors connect hubs of similar type (hubs containing forests are connected to one another; while those consisting primarily of wetlands are connected to others containing wetlands). Corridors generally follow the best ecological or \"most natural\" routes between hubs. Typically these are streams with wide riparian buffers and healthy fish communities. Other good wildlife corridors include ridge lines or forested valleys. Developed areas, major roads, and other unsuitable features were avoided.

The Maryland Department of Transportation State Highway Administration (MDOT SHA) currently reports this data only on the inventory direction (generally North or East) side of the roadway. Roadway Functional Classification data is not a complete representation of all roadway geometry.Maryland's roadway system is a vast network that connects places and people within and across county borders. Planners and engineers have developed elements of this network with particular travel objectives in mind. These objectives range from serving long-distance passenger and freight needs to serving neighborhood travel from residential developments to nearby shopping centers. The functional classification of roadways defines the role each element of the roadway network plays in serving these travel needs. \u200b Over the years, functional classification has come to assume additional significance beyond its purpose as a framework for identifying the particular role of a roadway in moving vehicles through a network of highways. Functional classification carries with it expectations about roadway design, including its speed, capacity and relationship to existing and future land use development. Federal legislation continues to use functional classification in determining eligibility for funding under the Federal-aid program. Transportation agencies describe roadway system performance, benchmarks and targets by functional classification. As agencies continue to move towards a more performance-based management approach, functional classification will be an increasingly important consideration in setting expectations and measuring outcomes for preservation, mobility and safety.Roadway Functional Classification data is developed as part of the Highway Performance Monitoring System (HPMS) which maintains and reports transportation related information to the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) on an annual basis.

Further, the LIHTC statute requires that no more than 20 percent of the metropolitan area population reside within designated QCTs (This limit also applies collectively to the nonmetropolitan counties in each state). Thus, it is possible for a tract to meet one or both of the above criteria, but not be designated as a QCT. With respect to the census tracts, the Census Bureau defines them in cooperation with local authorities every ten years for the purposes of the decennial census and, following a public comment period, has recently completed defining tract boundaries for the 2010 Census. Note that when census tract boundaries are set, they remain unchanged for the next decade. Thus, tract boundaries will not be changed until the 2020 Decennial Census.This is a MD iMAP hosted service.

TODs are generally higher density developments comprising a mix of residential, office, commercial, and civic uses in a pedestrian friendly environment within walking distance of a transit center. In 2008 the Maryland legislature adopted a formal definition for TOD as \"a dense, mixed-use, deliberately planned development within a half-mile of transit stations that is designed to increase transit ridership.\"Official designation of a TOD was enabled under statute in 2008. The intent of designation is to facilitate MDOT\u2019s more direct involvement in the above activities, by clarifying that in specific project areas (which must be within a half mile of a transit station), TOD is to be considered as a transportation purpose. By statute, TODs are to be automatically included in the interagency Sustainable Community designation, which implies eligibility\/prioritization for several state discretionary programs and expanded scope for local use of Tax Increment Finance (TIF) for related projects.The local jurisdiction with land use authority may nominate a project as part of their annual \u201cpriority letter\u201d for MDOT (generally due in April\/May). Staff works with local jurisdiction to define the nomination and collect background materials. Final materials are vetted with the Secretary of Transportation and the Smart Growth Sub-cabinet for recommendation.\u00a0The Secretary of Transportation conveys the outcomes of the review process, and offers official designation to local jurisdictions as appropriate. Local jurisdictions then take action to formalize the agreement (including boundaries) by official resolution. When this step is complete, the project is considered to be officially \u201cdesignated.\u201dThe designation does not imply that any specific funding or assistance will be automatically allocated. Needs and expectations of support from both state and local agencies should be clarified as part of the designation process.View More Information about Maryland's Transit Oriented Development on their story map:\u00a0http:\/\/bit.ly\/MDOT_TODThis is a MD iMAP hosted service.

MPO Boundaries\u2019 data includes information on each boundary's name, geographic location, and the total size \/ extent of each area. MPO Boundaries data was intended to be used for planning purposes within governments at the National and State level. Maryland's MPO Boundaries data is a sub-set of the U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT) Office of the Assistant Secretary for Research and Technology's Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS) National Transportation Atlas Database (NTAD).\u00a0A metropolitan planning organization (MPO) is a federally-mandated and federally-funded transportation policy-making organization that is made up of representatives from local governments and governmental transportation authorities. Federal law requires the formation of an MPO for any urbanized area (UZA) with a population greater than 50,000. Federal funding for transportation projects and programs are channeled through this planning process. Congress created MPOs to ensure that existing and future expenditures of federal funds for transportation projects and programs are based on a continuing, cooperative, and comprehensive (\u201c3\u2011C\u201d) planning process. MPOs are charged with developing a 20-year long-range transportation plan (LRTP) and a short-term (usually 2-6 years) program called the transportation improvement program (TIP) for each of their respective regions.\u00a0The seven MPOs of which Maryland jurisdictions and agencies are members are listed below.

This task is for a high resolution data set of lidar covering approximately 1,845 square miles. The lidar data was acquired and processed under the requirements identified in this task order. Lidar data is a remotely sensed high resolution elevation data collected by an airborne platform. The lidar sensor uses a combination of laser range finding, GPS positioning, and inertial measurement technologies. The lidar systems collect data point clouds that are used to produce highly detailed Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) of the earth's terrain, man-made structures, and vegetation. The task required the LiDAR data to be collected at a nominal pulse spacing (NPS) of 0.7 meters. The final products include classified LAS, one (1) meter pixel raster DEMs of the bare-earth surface in ERDAS IMG Format, and 8-bit intensity images. Each LAS file contains lidar point information, which has been calibrated, controlled, and classified. Additional deliverables include hydrologic breakline data, control data, tile index, lidar processing and survey reports in PDF format, FGDC metadata files for each data deliverable in .xml format, and LAS swath data. Ground conditions: Water at normal levels; no unusual inundation; no snow; leaf off. Coastal tiles 18SVH065720 and 8SVH095690 contain no lidar points as they exist completely in water. A DEM IMG was generated for these two tiles as the digitized hydro breakline assumed the data extent in the area. As such only 2568 LAS and Intensity files will be delivered along with 2570 DEM IMG's.This is a MD iMAP hosted service.

LiDAR data was delivered in RAW flight line swath format, processed to create Classified LAS 1.4 Files formatted to 6 individual 1829 meter X 1219 meter tiles for the pilot (948 individual 1829 meter X 1219 meter tiles for the entire project area), and corresponding Intensity Images and Bare Earth DEMs tiled to the same 1829 meter X 1219 meter tile schema, and Breaklines in Esri geodatabase format. Ground Conditions: LiDAR was collected in spring of 2015, while no snow was on the ground and rivers were at or below normal levels. In order to post process the LiDAR data to meet task order specifications, Quantum Spatial established a total of 87 Land Cover control points that were used to calibrate the LiDAR to known ground locations established throughout the Garrett County, MD project area (20 calibration control points).This is a MD iMAP hosted service.

Ground conditions: Water at normal levels; no unusual inundation; no snow; leaf off. Coastal tiles 18SVH065720 and 8SVH095690 contain no lidar points as they exist completely in water. A DEM IMG was generated for these two tiles as the digitized hydro breakline assumed the data extent in the area.

This task is for a high resolution data set of lidar covering approximately 1,845 square miles. The lidar data was acquired and processed under the requirements identified in this task order. Lidar data is a remotely sensed high resolution elevation data collected by an airborne platform. The lidar sensor uses a combination of laser range finding, GPS positioning, and inertial measurement technologies. The lidar systems collect data point clouds that are used to produce highly detailed Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) of the earth's terrain, man-made structures, and vegetation. The task required the LiDAR data to be collected at a nominal pulse spacing (NPS) of 0.7 meters. The final products include classified LAS, one (1) meter pixel raster DEMs of the bare-earth surface in ERDAS IMG Format, and 8-bit intensity images. Each LAS file contains lidar point information, which has been calibrated, controlled, and classified. Additional deliverables include hydrologic breakline data, control data, tile index, lidar processing and survey reports in PDF format, FGDC metadata files for each data deliverable in .xml format, and LAS swath data.

This task is for a high resolution data set of lidar covering approximately 1,845 square miles. The lidar data was acquired and processed under the requirements identified in this task order. Lidar data is a remotely sensed high resolution elevation data collected by an airborne platform. The lidar sensor uses a combination of laser range finding, GPS positioning, and inertial measurement technologies. The lidar systems collect data point clouds that are used to produce highly detailed Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) of the earth's terrain, man-made structures, and vegetation. The task required the LiDAR data to be collected at a nominal pulse spacing (NPS) of 0.7 meters. The final products include classified LAS, one (1) meter pixel raster DEMs of the bare-earth surface in ERDAS IMG Format, and 8-bit intensity images. Each LAS file contains lidar point information, which has been calibrated, controlled, and classified. Additional deliverables include hydrologic breakline data, control data, tile index, lidar processing and survey reports in PDF format, FGDC metadata files for each data deliverable in .xml format, and LAS swath data.

This agreement included commitments for providing fish passage within each state: \"to provide for fish passage at dams, and remove stream blockages wherever necessary to restore passage for migratory fish.\" With this humble beginning, the Chesapeake Bay states set a goal to reopen a total of 1,357 miles of historical spawning grounds by the year 2003. Maryland's portion of this goal is to reopen 388.65 miles of stream. The Maryland Department of Natural Resources Fish Passage Program has taken this commitment very seriously; to date the Program has completed 61 projects, reopening a total 348.9 miles of upstream spawning habitat. Several projects scheduled to be completed by 2003 will allow the Program to not only meet but also exceed the goal set forth by the Chesapeake Bay Agreement. Meeting this goal has been a cooperative effort between the Maryland Department of Natural Resources, State Highway Administration, National Marine Fisheries Service - National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration, Department of Interior - US Fish & Wildlife, Environmental Protection Agency, Chesapeake Bay Program, Chesapeake Bay Foundation, University Maryland and a multitude of others including private citizens, local watershed groups and local governments.This is a MD iMAP hosted service.

(EDI) of Gaithersburg, Md., to extract shorelines from an existing wetlands delineation, which was based on photo interpretation of 3.75-minute digital orthophoto quarter quads (DOQQs). In areas where a wetlands coverage was not yet available, EDI interpreted shorelines directly from the orthophotography. DOQQ registration (Maryland State Plane Coordinate System, NAD 83, meters) was transferred automatically to the shoreline vectors.

In order to better understand the impacts sea level rise may have on the State's coastal marsh system, the Sea-Level Affecting Marshes Model (SLAMM) was run for all 16 coastal counties and Baltimore City.SLAMM uses elevation, accumulation of sediments, wetland accretion and erosion rates, and sea level rise to predicatively model long-term wetland and shoreline change. In Maryland, SLAMM was run using the best available science, including sea level rise rate identified at 3.4 feet by year 2100. The resulting changes to coastal marshes and shorelines can be visualized in their current state, 2050 and 2100 year scenarios. These results will be used to help frame new land conservation targeting in Maryland's coastal zone.

Between 1988-1992, ~2.9 million m^3 was dredged from Borrow Area 2, ~4.2 million m^3 dredged from Borrow Area 3, and ~3.2 million m^3 dredged from Borrow Area 9 (Wells, 1994).Revised volumentric estimations for Shoals B, C, D, Little Gull Bank & Great Gull Bank (1996) \"In the 1993 sand resources study (Conkwright and Gast, 1994b) the seismically defined ravinement surface was used as the lower structural boundary for volume calculations. However, the purpose of the current study is to estimate only the volume of sand with measured physical parameters. Therefore, the lower boundary for volumetric calculations was determined primarily by the grain size parameters of vibracore samples. The lower boundary surface was set at the depth where the sampled sand became too fine or too poorly sorted for use as beach fill. In those cases where the entire length of core contained usable sand, the boundary surface was set at the depth of maximum vibracore penetration. Because vibracore penetrations on Little and Great Gull Banks were generally within a meter of the ravinement surface, that surface was used as the lower boundary for those shoals, unless vibracore samples indicated otherwise.\" (Conkwright and Williams, 1996).REFS:Conkwright, R.D. and R.A.Gast. 1994a.

As part of this initiative, a critical element is the identification of Wind Energy Areas (WEA) on the Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) off the Atlantic coast. WEAs are offshore locations that appear most suitable for wind energy development. Secretary Salazar identified the WEAs on February 7, 2011 in a joint announcement with Secretary Chu of the U.S. Department of Energy as part of the National Strategic Work Plan for Offshore Wind.

By combining a sophisticated numerical weather model capable of simulating large-scale wind patterns with a microscale wind flow model responsive to local terrain and surface conditions, they enable the mapping of wind resources with much greater accuracy than has been possible in the past. In addition, they do not require surface wind data to make accurate predictions. While on-site measurements will be required to confirm the predicted wind resource at any particular location, mesoscale-microscale modeling can greatly reduce the time and cost required to identify and evaluate potential wind project sites. This map was created by AWS Truepower, LLC using the MesoMap system and historical weather data. Although it is believed to represent an accurate overall picture of the wind energy resource, estimates at any location should be confirmed by measurement.This is a MD iMAP hosted service layer.

This application is based on their Marine Mammal and Seabird Computer Database Analysis System (MMS-CDAS). The origin of the underlying data is a U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service aerial survey conducted between December, 2001 and March, 2003. The source data were collected on-transect (120m width, 60 m each side) for transects conducted in the mouth of Chesapeake Bay, in Delaware Bay, and in offshore waters from the beach outward. Aerial surveys of waterbirds were flown to at least 12 nautical miles (22.2 km) offshore from northern New Jersey to the Virginia \/ North Carolina border. All waterbird species in the USFWS database from winter surveys only were exported to density blocks. Information in the MMS application suggests the winter surveys only are valid for calculating densities because they were flown on specific transects.

Utilizing various land protection programs and funding sources, the Maryland Department of Natural Resources has preserved environmentally important lands through the use of perpetual conservation easements. The Forest Legacy Program is designed to identify and protect environmentally important forest lands that are threatened by present or future conversion to non-forest use through the use of perpetual conservation easements between willing sellers and willing buyers. Only private forest land in a Forest Legacy Area is eligible for the program. Marylands Conservation Reserve Enhancement Program (CREP) has helped thousands of Maryland landowners plant streamside buffers, establish wetlands, protect highly erodible land, and create wildlife habitat. The State of Maryland has entered into a memorandum of Agreement with USDA authorizing the State of Maryland to continue the voluntary program for the purchase of perpetual easements for Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) land. A perpetual CREP easement is a written legal agreement between a landowner and the State of Maryland in which there is an acquired permanent interest in the land to install or maintain conservation practices that protect water quality and natural resources. The Maryland Department of Natural Resources (DNR) administers the CREP easement program. DNR is also assisted by a number of local governments and non-government organization sponsors.Data from individual county and state records were used in production of DNR Lands.

These baseline data will inform planning efforts being undertaken by the Maryland Department of Natural Recources to help develop a Maryland Ocean Plan. Collecting data on the variety of ways you use the Seaside Bays and Atlantic Ocean will help us plan for reducing use conflicts in our coastal waters, maximizing efficiency, and enhancing environmental and economic productivity. State and federally managed waters of Maryland and the U.S. are used in many ways: commercial fishing, aquaculture, shipping, military exercises, sand mining, habitat for wildlife, and recreation. With new and expanding coastal and ocean uses emerging such as energy production and increased shipping and considering Maryland coastal population is increasing, the pressure is mounting to ensure that there is space for both traditional and new uses and that conflicts are minimized.

The centerline represents the geographic location on the roadway between both shoulders (physical center), which often but not always coincides with the center painted line dividing bi-directional travel lanes. Roadway Centerlines data plays an important role in transportation management and planning, while also being the basis for all other roadway related data products.Maryland Roadway Centerline data is the end product of a statewide data sharing process between the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), Maryland Department of Transportation (MDOT), Maryland Department of Transportation State Highway Administration (MDOT SHA), county governments and local municipal governments. Using a common centerline allows for better exchange of information related to the roadway system and provides opportunities for more efficient collection of information about roadway assets. Some centerlines were created in-house using imagery, GPS data, and MDOT SHA's Highway Performance Monitoring System (HPMS) database and others were received from county governments and updated in house using imagery, GPS data and MDOT SHA's HPMS database. The Centerline data includes annual HPMS updates \/ improvements submitted to the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA).\u00a0Maryland Roadway Centerline data is needed for emergency response and management, routing buses and other vehicles, planning for land use and transportation needs, continuity of roadway data and display at county boundaries leading to the same \"look and feel\" across jurisdictions, tracking assets on and along the roadway network, producing maps at various scales, and numerous other applications. There are opportunities to make these processes more efficient, and this program addresses a shared foundation to solve some of these issues. This data is also used by various business units throughout MDOT, as well as many other Federal, State and local government agencies.\u00a0Maryland Roadway Centerline data is updated and published on an annual basis for the prior year.

Identifying long-term planning options to increase resiliency against coastal storm surge, flooding, and erosion is an important step in protecting Maryland's coastal zone. Much of our natural buffering capacity against these coastal hazards, come from our coastal wetlands. In order to better understand the impacts sea level rise may have on the State's coastal marsh system, the Sea-Level Affecting Marshes Model (SLAMM) was run for all 16 coastal counties and Baltimore City. The results of SLAMM were analyzed for specific conservation criteria for long-term planning that may help increase coastal resiliency in Maryland. The conservation criteria included areas that may support future wetland migration, wildlife habitat, wildlife corridors, high priority aquatic and terrestrial living resources, vulnerable wetland habitat, suitable hydric soils for wetland establishment and marsh-dependent breeding bird habitat. From these criteria a conservation model was developed to prioritize the most important areas for wetland adaptation. As a result the top priorities were used to create the Wetland Adaptation Areas for the Targeted Ecological Areas (TEAs) used in Marylands GreenPrint.

MGS contracted the services of EarthData International, Inc. (EDI), currently of Frederick, Md., to extract shorelines from an existing wetlands delineation, which was based on photo interpretation of 3.75-minute digital orthophoto quarter quads (DOQQs). The 2000 baseline which were not created seaward includes all Maryland shoreline areas except for Anne Arundel, Baltimore, Calvert, Harford and Prince George's counties currently. The newest (2015) updated baselines were created offshore (seaward) of the shorelines utilized in DSAS analysis. The baselines were created by 1) buffering at a distance of 10m around the master shoreline feature class converting the buffer polygon to a line, and erasing the landward portion of the buffer line; and 2)manually digitizing baselines up the centerline of tributaries\/rivers and other areas where baselines were needed but the buffer-created baselines did not reach.\u00a0Funding for this data set was provided by two Projects of Special Merit (CZM # 14-14-1868 CZM 143 and CZM # 14-15-2005 CZM 143), funded by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and made available to MGS through the Department of Natural Resources (MD DNR) Chesapeake and Coastal Service (CCS).

Based on the results of an End Point Rate (EPR) analysis on the ca. 1990s MGS shoreline and the ca. 2000 NOAA CUSP shoreline (recent shoreline), MGS grouped the rate results into the following general categories: (a) No change (-0.01 to 0.01 feet\/year), (b) Accretion (greater than 0.01 feet\/year), (c) Slight erosion rate (0 to -2 feet\/year), (d) Low erosion rate (-2 to -4 feet\/year), (e) Moderate erosion rate (-4 to -8 ft\/yr), (f) High erosion rate (greater than -8 feet\/year), (g) Protected, (h) No data (insufficient shorelines to calculate 10-year EPR rate), (i) No data (no transects cast; unprotected or unknown shoreline condition), and (j) Rates not delivered (calculated rates suspect). The NOAA CUSP shoreline represents the shoreline position in Harford County between the years 2005-2007. Negative rate of change values indicate erosion, and positive values indicate accretion.

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) shorelines were acquired online from the 1) NOAA Historical Surveys (T-sheets) data set (http:\/\/shoreline.noaa.gov\/data\/datasheets\/t-sheets.html), 2) the NOAA National Shoreline data set (http:\/\/shoreline.noaa.gov\/data\/datasheets\/index.html), and 3) the NOAA Continually Updated Shoreline Product (CUSP) data set (http:\/\/shoreline.noaa.gov\/data\/datasheets\/cusp.html). The ca. 1940 Maryland Geological Survey (MGS) shorelines were extracted in the early 1990s from Coastal Survey maps (topographic or T-sheets) produced by the National Ocean Service (NOS), a branch of NOAA. MGS digitized these shorelines directly from bromide or mylar copies of the Coastal Survey maps. The ca. 1990 MGS shorelines were digitized by EarthData International, Inc. (EDI) of Gaithersburg, MD in 2000. EDI extracted the shorelines from an existing wetlands delineation, which was based on photo interpretation of 3.75-minute digital orthophoto quarter quads (DOQQs). This shoreline feature class was created by appending the twenty individual shoreline data sets into one master shoreline feature class file, and retains the original attribute field names from the twenty input files. As such, the original attribute information for each input dataset is part of this final shoreline feature class. MGS also created seven additional attribute fields, some which are required for DSAS analysis and some of which facilitated general data management\/analysis -- DSAS_DATE, DSAS_UNC, DSAS_SRC, DSAS_DEC, DSAS_CO, DSAS_NPROJ, and DSAS_SLINF. Here is a list of the individual data sets (by source) compiled for this master shoreline feature class (all data sets clipped to county boundaries): 1) NOAA Historical Surveys (T-sheets) data sets -- CM7202; 2) NOAA National Shoreline data sets -- CS288, MD1932A1, MD1932A2, MD1932A3, MD1932B, MD1933D, MD1933E, MD1933F, MD1934A, CS307, MD1941A1, PH6008, PH6009A, PH6609, CM7415, and CM7601; 3) MGS data sets -- 1940 and 1990 MGS shoreline; and 4) NOAA CUSP data set.This is a MD iMAP hosted service.

Shorelines were derived from three sources: (1) maps from a Historical Shorelines and Erosion Rates Atlas (Conkwright, 1975), (2) Coastal Survey maps (topographic or T-sheets) produced by the National Ocean Service (NOS), a branch of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), and (3) a digital wetlands delineation based on photo interpretation of digital orthophoto quarter quads. DSAS constructed a \u201cbaseline\u201d landward of and approximately parallel to the shorelines, inserted nodes every 20 m along the baseline, and cast straight-line transects from each node, perpendicular to the baseline, across the shorelines. Based on the time elapsed and the along-transect distance between shoreline pairs, DSAS calculated rates of change for each transect.Subsequently, updates began in 2015 is updating by county the DSAS process using newer Shoreline data and refined calculations to update the Rates of Change erosion values by county.

Stream Waders is the volunteer component of the Maryland Biological Stream Survey (MBSS).Goals of Stream Waders are: to increase the density of sampling sites for use in stream and watershed assessments; to improve stream stewardship ethics and encourage local action to improve watershed management; to educate the local community about the relationship between land use and stream quality; and to provide quality assured information on stream quality to state, local, and federal agencies, environmental organizations, and others.Stream Waders is designed to be seamless with the MBSS and several other stream sampling programs in Maryland. MBSS samples are collected at the watershed level (8-digit Hydrologic Unit Code (HUC); about 70 square miles each), while Stream Waders volunteers sample at a smaller scale subwatersheds at the 12-digit HUC; about 8 square miles each). Thus, Stream Waders data should help \u201cfill the gaps\u201d left in watershed areas not sampled by MBSS.

The Numbering Plan Areas reflect current and accurate boundary changes both where new NPAs split from existing NPAs and where new NPAs overlay existing NPAs. When an NPA is split, the geographic area covered by the old area code is divided geographically, with one portion retaining the previous area code and the other switching to the new area code.

Alexander and others (1999) developed ERF1, which assessed the hydrologic integrity of the digital reach traces and calculated the mean water time-of-travel in river reaches and reservoirs. ERF1-2 serves as the foundation for SPARROW (Spatially Referenced Regressions (of nutrient transport) On Watershed) modeling. Within the context of a Geographic Information System, SPARROW estimates the proportion of watersheds in the conterminous U.S. with outflow concentrations of several nutrients, including total nitrogen and total phosphorus, (Smith, R.A., Schwarz, G.E., and Alexander, R.B., 1997). This version of the network expands on ERF1 (version 1.2; Alexander et al. 1999), and includes the incremental and total drainage area derived from 1-kilometer (km) elevation data for North America. Previous estimates of the water time-of-travel were recomputed for reaches with water- quality monitoring sites that included two reaches. The mean flow and velocity estimates for these split reaches are based on previous estimation methods (Alexander et al., 1999) and are unchanged in ERF1-2. Drainage area calculations provide data used to estimate the contribution of a given nutrient to the outflow. Data estimates depend on the accuracy of node connectivity. Reaches split at water- quality or pesticide-monitoring sites indicate the source point for estimating the contribution and transport of nutrients and their loads throughout the watersheds. The ERF1-2 coverage extends the earlier ERF1 coverage by providing digital-elevation-model (DEM-based estimates of reach drainage area founded on the 1-kilometer data for North America (Verdin, 1996; Verdin and Jenson, 1996). A 1-kilometer raster grid of ERF1-2 projected to Lambert Azimuthal Equal Area, NAD 27 Datum (Snyder, 1987), was merged with the HYDRO1K flow direction data set (Verdin and Jenson, 1996) to generate a DEM-based watershed grid, ERF1_2WS. The watershed boundaries are maintained in a raster (grid cell) format as well as a vector (polygon) format for subsequent model analysis. Both the coverage, ERF1-2, and the grid, ERF1-2WS are available at: http:\/\/water.usgs.gov\/lookup\/gisgetlist.\u00a0The version of RF1 used to compile ERF1-2 was an early edition of a USGS RF1 translation and was updated by USEPA (USEPA, 1996). The capabilities of the enhanced version of RF1 (ERF1-2) and the current USEPA version have not been evaluated.

Hydrologic units through four levels were created in the 1970's and have been used extensively throughout the United States. During that time the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) developed a hierarchical hydrologic unit code (HUC) for the United States. This system divides the country into 21 Regions, 222 Subregions, 352 Accounting Units, and 2,149 Cataloging Units based on surface hydrologic features. The smallest USGS unit (8-digit HU) is approximately 448,000 acres. During the late 1970's the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), formerly the Soil Conservation Service, initiated a national program to further subdivide HU's into smaller watersheds for water resources planning. A 3-digit extension was added to the 8-digit identification. By the early 1980's this 11-digit HU mapping was completed for most of the U.S. These data demonstrate Maryland's watersheds as represented by the federal Hydrologic Unit Code denoted by an 11-digit numerical code. The watersheds were defined using contours on U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) 7.5 minute quadrangle map sheets. The state has been divided into 138 watersheds that are identified by Maryland, using an 8-digit numerical code. These watersheds are equivalent to the HUC 11-digit codes. The watershed file is generally considered to be map accurate at a scale of 1:24,000. A new 12-digit watershed file is available from DNR which provides more detailed line work for over 1,100 watersheds which is approximately equivalent to the HUC 14-digit code.The Department of Natural Resources makes no warranty, expressed or implied, as to the use or appropriateness of Spatial Data, and there are no warranties of merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose or use.

These data delineate the areal extent of wetlands and surface waters as defined by Cowardin et al. (1979). Certain wetland habitats are excluded from the National mapping program because of the limitations of aerial imagery as the primary data source used to detect wetlands. These habitats include seagrasses or submerged aquatic vegetation that are found in the intertidal and subtidal zones of estuaries and near shore coastal waters. Some deepwater reef communities (coral or tuberficid worm reefs) have also been excluded from the inventory. These habitats, because of their depth, go undetected by aerial imagery. By policy, the Service also excludes certain types of \"farmed wetlands\" as may be defined by the Food Security Act or that do not coincide with the Cowardin et al. definition. Contact the Service's Regional Wetland Coordinator for additional information on what types of farmed wetlands are included on wetland maps.This is a MD iMAP hosted service layer.
