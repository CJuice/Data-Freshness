MTA and partner state, local, and other agencies shall assume no liability for errors, omissions, or inaccuracies in the information provided regardless of how caused; or any decision made or action taken or not taken by any person relying on any information or data furnished within. ***\r\n\r\nThis dataset assesses rail station potential for different forms of transit oriented development (TOD). A key driver of increased transit ridership in Maryland, TOD capitalizes on existing rapid transit infrastructure. The online tool focuses on the MTA\u2019s existing MARC Commuter Rail, Metro Subway, and Central Light Rail lines and includes information specific to each station. \r\n\r\nThe goal of this dataset is to give MTA planning staff, developers, local governments, and transit riders a picture of how each MTA rail station could attract TOD investment. In order to make this assessment, MTA staff gathered data on characteristics that are likely to influence TOD potential. The station-specific data is organized into 6 different categories referring to transit activity; station facilities; parking provision and utilization; bicycle and pedestrian access; and local zoning and land availability around each station. \r\n\r\nAs a publicly shared resource, this dataset can be used by local communities to identify and prioritize area improvements in coordination with the MTA that can help attract investment around rail stations.\r\n\r\nYou can view an interactive version of this dataset at geodata.md.gov\/tod.\r\n\r\n ** Ridership is calculated the following ways:\r\nMetro Rail ridership is based on Metro gate exit counts.\r\nLight Rail ridership is estimated using a statistical sampling process in line with FTA established guidelines, and approved by the FTA.\r\nMARC ridership is calculated using two (2) independent methods:\r\nMonthly Line level ridership is estimated using a statistical sampling process in line with FTA established guidelines, and approved by the FTA. This method of ridership calculation is used by the MTA for official reporting purposes to State level and Federal level reporting.\r\nStation level ridership is estimated by using person counts completed by the third party vendor. This method of calculation has not been verified by the FTA for statistical reporting and is used for scheduling purposes only. However, because of the granularity of detail, this information is useful for TOD applications.\r\n*Please note that the monthly level ridership and the station level ridership are calculated using two (2) independent methods that are not interchangeable and should not be compared for analysis purposes.","four_by_four":"cqt2-ypem","date_of_most_recent_data_change":1548946388000,"portal":"Socrata","data_provided_by":"MTA","keyword_tags_string":"mta, tod, transit, oriented, development, station, map, marc, train, metro, transportation","title":"MTA Transit Oriented Development (TOD) Data","type_":"dcat:Dataset","landing_page":"https:\/\/opendata.maryland.gov\/d\/cqt2-ypem"},{"category_string":"Health and Human Services","description":"Babies with Low Birth Weight - This indicator shows the percentage of live births that are a low birth weight (2500 grams or less).

The primary objective is to develop viable communities, provide decent housing and a suitable living environment, and to expand economic opportunities, principally for persons of low and moderate income. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) oversees the Program.\r\n\r\nThe Program is comprised of two parts. The Entitlement Program is directly administered by HUD and provides Federal funds to large metropolitan entitlement communities. The States and Small Cities Program provides Federal funds to the States and Puerto Rico (with the exception of Hawaii) who then distribute funds to non-entitlement counties, small cities and towns. Congress\u200b allocates funds to the program annually. The Entitlement Program receives approximately 70% of the allocation and the remaining 30% is distributed to the States and Small Cities Program.\r\n\r\nMaryland's Community Development Block Grant Program is administered by the Maryland Department of Housing and Community Development. The State receives an allocation from the Department of Housing and Urban Development each July.\r\n\r\nDISCLAIMER: Some of the information may be tied to the Department\u2019s bond funded loan programs and should not be relied upon in making an investment decision.
